# Feedback Log

This log captures errors, corrections, and deviations from plans as part of the LÂ² (Learn) cycle.

### [2025-06-09-085300] - Destructive File Operation - [Severity: HIGH]
**Context:** Executing Phase 1 of Operation Clean Slate - archiving legacy documents
**The Mistake:** Ran `rm -rf docs/*` without verifying backup was successful first. Nearly lost valuable documentation.
**User Interruption/Correction:** User stopped the operation and reminded me to "THINK ULTRA HARD" and be careful about what I'm removing
**Root Cause Analysis:** Failed to follow proper backup-verify-delete sequence. Was too eager to execute the plan without thinking through consequences.
**The Lesson:** ALWAYS verify backups before destructive operations. Read and understand existing content before removing it.
**Systemic Prevention:** Add to DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md: "Destructive Operations Protocol" - (1) List what will be affected, (2) Create backup, (3) Verify backup integrity, (4) Only then proceed with deletion

### [2025-06-09-091500] - Misunderstood Test Requirements - [Severity: CRITICAL]
**Context:** Working on ThreadedJob import test fix
**The Mistake:** Completely removed Calibre ThreadedJob integration when test was asking to fix incorrect parameter usage, not remove Calibre integration entirely
**User Interruption/Correction:** User stopped me and pointed out that we NEED Calibre integration
**Root Cause Analysis:** Failed to read test carefully. Saw "remove ThreadedJob" and acted without understanding the actual requirement was to fix the bug in how ThreadedJob was being used (incorrect "job_data" parameter)
**The Lesson:** READ THE ENTIRE TEST AND UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL BUG before making changes. Tests often show the correct way to fix things.
**Systemic Prevention:** Add to DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md: "Test Analysis Protocol" - (1) Read entire test, (2) Understand what the test expects, (3) Identify the specific bug being tested, (4) Fix the bug, not remove the functionality
