Resume work on the Calibre Semantic Search plugin. Run these checks:

1. **Check Git Status**:
   ```bash
   git status --short
   git log --oneline -5
   git diff --stat
   ```

2. **Read Current Context**:
   - Read CLAUDE.md section "CURRENT ACTIVE TASK"
   - Check PROJECT_STATUS.md for "Critical Issues" and "Next Actions"
   - Look for incomplete work marked with ‚ùå

3. **Verify Build Status**:
   ```bash
   # Try building the plugin
   python scripts/build_plugin.py
   
   # Check for any test failures
   python -m pytest tests/ -x --tb=short --quiet
   ```

4. **Check Known Issues**:
   - Missing _on_threshold_changed method in search_dialog.py?
   - Missing _copy_citation method in search_dialog.py?
   - Search still showing placeholder?
   - Theme manager not applied?
   - Index manager not accessible?

5. **Review Recent Changes**:
   ```bash
   # See what was recently modified
   git diff HEAD~1 --name-only
   
   # Check for TODO/FIXME markers
   grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME" calibre_plugins/ | head -10
   ```

6. **Set Working Context**:
   - Show me the highest priority issue to work on
   - Display the specific files and methods involved
   - Remind me of any special testing procedures

Give me a concise summary of where we left off and what to do next.
