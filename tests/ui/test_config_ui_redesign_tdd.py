TDD Anchors for Configuration UI Redesign

User Story: "As a user setting up semantic search, I want a clear, guided 
experience that shows me exactly what I need for each provider and helps 
me choose the right model for my needs."

Current Problems:
- UI has both model_combo_provider AND model_edit (confusing)
- Only Azure gets provider-specific sections
- No search functionality for models  
- No model information (dimensions, cost, etc.)
- Poor visual hierarchy and guidance

Target UX:
- Clear provider selection with immediate visual feedback
- Provider-specific configuration sections that appear/hide cleanly
- Searchable model dropdown with metadata
- Clear required vs optional field indicators
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
