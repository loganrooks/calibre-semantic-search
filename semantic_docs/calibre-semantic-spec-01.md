# Calibre Semantic Search Plugin - Executive Summary & Quick Start Guide

## Project Vision

The Calibre Semantic Search Plugin transforms Calibre from a traditional keyword-based ebook manager into an AI-powered research platform specifically optimized for philosophical and academic texts. By leveraging state-of-the-art embedding models and vector similarity search, this plugin enables researchers to discover conceptual relationships between texts that would be impossible to find with traditional search methods.

## Core Problem Statement

Current Calibre search functionality is limited to exact keyword matching, which fails to capture:
- Conceptual relationships between different philosophical traditions
- Evolution of ideas across time periods and languages
- Implicit connections between texts using different terminology
- Nuanced philosophical concepts that resist simple keyword definition

## Solution Overview

A plugin-based semantic search system that:
1. Generates AI embeddings for all text chunks in a Calibre library
2. Enables similarity-based search across concepts, not just keywords
3. Provides specialized tools for philosophical research workflows
4. Maintains full compatibility with Calibre's update cycle

## Key Stakeholders

### Primary Users
- **Continental Philosophy Researchers**: Need to trace concept genealogies across traditions
- **Academic Philosophers**: Require cross-reference capabilities for citation networks
- **Graduate Students**: Need efficient literature review tools
- **Digital Humanities Scholars**: Want computational approaches to textual analysis

### Secondary Users
- **General Calibre Users**: Benefit from improved search capabilities
- **Library Scientists**: Can better organize philosophical collections
- **Translators**: Can find parallel passages across languages

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Search Performance**: <100ms latency for 10,000 book library
- **Indexing Speed**: â‰¥50 books/hour with default settings
- **Memory Efficiency**: <500MB RAM during normal operation
- **Storage Efficiency**: ~4.4GB per 1,000 books (with compression)
- **Accuracy**: >90% relevance for philosophical concept searches

### Qualitative Metrics
- **User Satisfaction**: >85% of philosophical researchers find it useful
- **Workflow Integration**: Reduces literature review time by >50%
- **Concept Discovery**: Enables finding previously unknown connections
- **Cross-Language Capability**: Successfully links concepts across 5+ languages

## Technical Approach

### Core Technologies
1. **Embedding Models**: Vertex AI's text-embedding-preview-0815 (primary)
2. **Vector Database**: SQLite with sqlite-vec extension
3. **Integration Framework**: Calibre's InterfaceAction plugin system
4. **UI Framework**: Qt 5.12+ for native integration
5. **Fallback Providers**: OpenAI, Cohere, local models via LiteLLM

### Architecture Principles
- **Plugin-Based**: All functionality via Calibre's plugin system
- **Non-Invasive**: No modifications to Calibre core
- **Extensible**: Pluggable components for all major systems
- **Resilient**: Fallback mechanisms at every level
- **Progressive**: Graceful degradation for large libraries

## Development Methodology

### SPARC Framework
1. **Specification**: Comprehensive requirements documentation (this phase)
2. **Pseudocode**: Detailed algorithmic descriptions
3. **Architecture**: Component design and integration
4. **Refinement**: Iterative improvement based on testing
5. **Completion**: Full implementation with all tests passing

### Test-Driven Development
- Write test first for every feature
- Test philosophical correctness, not just code correctness
- Maintain >80% code coverage
- Performance benchmarks for all operations

## Quick Start for Developers

### Prerequisites Check
```bash
# Verify Calibre installation
calibre --version  # Should be 5.0.0+

# Python environment
python --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-qt pytest-benchmark

# Vector extension
# Download sqlite-vec for your platform
```

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone Calibre source (for reference)
git clone https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre.git calibre-src

# Create plugin development structure
mkdir calibre-semantic-search
cd calibre-semantic-search

# Initialize git repository
git init
git add .gitignore README.md

# Create plugin skeleton
mkdir -p calibre_plugins/semantic_search
touch calibre_plugins/semantic_search/__init__.py
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Always start with a failing test**
2. **Implement minimal code to pass**
3. **Refactor with tests green**
4. **Document as you go**
5. **Benchmark performance regularly**

## Risk Assessment Summary

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Viewer Integration**: Limited by Qt WebEngine restrictions
2. **Performance at Scale**: Vector search with millions of chunks
3. **API Dependencies**: Rate limits and availability
4. **Cross-Platform**: Different Qt behaviors per OS

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Viewer**: Use floating windows and context menus
2. **Scale**: Implement sharding and caching
3. **APIs**: Multiple fallback providers
4. **Platform**: Extensive cross-platform testing
