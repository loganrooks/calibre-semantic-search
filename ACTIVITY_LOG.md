# Activity Log

This log tracks all development actions taken as part of the SPARC-V-L³ protocol.

### [2025-06-09-085500] - Operation Clean Slate - Phase 1
*   **Goal:** Execute Phase 1 of BLUEPRINT: Workspace Refactoring & Knowledge Base Synthesis
*   **Analysis:** Examined project structure, found test files scattered in root, valuable docs in docs/, multiple legacy markdown files
*   **Actions:** 
    - Created archive/pre_refactor_20250609/ directory
    - Moved legacy markdown files from root to archive
    - Organized test files from root into proper test directories
    - Created backup of docs/ before any modifications
    - Preserved existing valuable documentation
*   **Rationale:** Need to establish single source of truth while preserving valuable existing documentation

### [2025-06-09-090000] - Phase 1 Knowledge Base Creation
*   **Goal:** Create new authoritative documents per BLUEPRINT templates
*   **Analysis:** Nearly deleted valuable docs but recovered via git restore, learned importance of verification
*   **Actions:**
    - Created new CLAUDE.md with SPARC-V-L³ directives
    - Created docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with MVP pattern documentation
    - Created docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md with mandatory workflows
    - Created PROJECT_STATUS.md tracking Operation Clean Slate
    - Created CHANGELOG.md in Keep a Changelog format
    - Created docs/TEST_SUITE_REPAIR_PLAN.md with detailed fixes
    - Created docs/UI_REWORK_PLAN.md for focus bug fix
    - Created docs/decisions/ADR_TEMPLATE.md for future decisions
*   **Rationale:** Establishing single source of truth with clear, authoritative documentation per BLUEPRINT requirements

### [2025-06-09-092000] - Phase 2 Test Suite Repair - Critical & High Priority Fixes
*   **Goal:** Execute TEST_SUITE_REPAIR_PLAN.md to fix failing test infrastructure
*   **Analysis:** Identified 3 critical/high priority issues: AsyncMock in EPUB tests, ThreadedJob import errors, missing IndexDetector module
*   **Actions:**
    - Fixed EPUB integration test by updating async mock usage and fixing repository store_embedding method to auto-create indexes
    - Fixed Calibre integration test by removing ThreadedJob from interface.py and updating BackgroundJobManager to handle real indexing work while maintaining Calibre integration
    - Created missing IndexDetector module with get_index_status, format_status_for_display, and get_status_icon methods per test specifications
*   **Rationale:** These fixes restore test suite reliability for core functionality (indexing) and integration (Calibre job system) while providing missing UI components

### [2025-06-09-093000] - Phase 3 Core System Implementation - Logging Integration  
*   **Goal:** Integrate core logging system into interface.py and replace print statements with structured logging
*   **Analysis:** Core logging_config.py was ready but not yet integrated into the main interface, multiple print statements throughout interface.py should use structured logging
*   **Actions:**
    - Added setup_logging(self.name) call as first operation in SemanticSearchInterface.genesis() method  
    - Created self.logger instance for the interface module using proper naming convention
    - Systematically replaced all print() statements in _initialize_services method with appropriate logger calls (info, warning, error)
    - Updated all static logger references to use self.logger instance throughout interface.py
    - Maintained consistent logging levels: info for normal operations, warning for recoverable issues, error for failures
*   **Rationale:** Establishes structured logging with rotating file handlers, console output for development, and consistent formatting across all plugin operations. Essential for debugging and monitoring in production Calibre environments.

### [2025-06-09-094500] - Phase 3 UI Rework - LocationPresenter TDD Implementation
*   **Goal:** Implement MVP pattern LocationPresenter to fix focus-stealing bug following TDD methodology
*   **Analysis:** Created test-driven development approach with 7 comprehensive test cases covering typing delays, timer management, batching, and cleanup
*   **Actions:**
    - Created calibre_plugins/semantic_search/presenters/ module structure
    - Implemented test_location_presenter.py with 7 test cases following UI_REWORK_PLAN.md specifications
    - Created LocationPresenter class with debounced text change handling using threading.Timer
    - Implemented configurable typing delay (default 500ms) to prevent focus interruption during typing
    - Added proper timer cleanup and cancellation to prevent resource leaks
    - Verified all 7 tests pass: typing delays, batching, timer cancellation, configuration, cleanup
*   **Rationale:** MVP pattern separates UI concerns from business logic, preventing focus-stealing by deferring view updates until typing stops. TDD ensures robust implementation before integration.

### [2025-06-09-100000] - Phase 3 UI Rework - MVP Pattern DynamicLocationComboBox Implementation
*   **Goal:** Refactor DynamicLocationComboBox to MVP pattern to fix focus-stealing bug following UI_REWORK_PLAN.md
*   **Analysis:** Created specialized LocationComboPresenter for region fetching/filtering logic and refactored view to be "dumb" UI component
*   **Actions:**
    - Created LocationComboPresenter extending base LocationPresenter with region-specific functionality
    - Implemented dynamic region fetching, filtering, and provider switching in presenter layer
    - Created DynamicLocationComboBox MVP version with clean separation: view handles only UI updates, presenter handles all business logic
    - Added required MVP interface methods: update_locations(), set_loading_state(), cleanup()
    - Implemented focus-preserving view updates using blockSignals() and cursor position preservation
    - Replaced all print statements with proper logging using self.logger
    - Created verification test to ensure focus-stealing bug is fixed
    - Plugin builds successfully (128.7 KB vs 121.2 KB before, confirming new files included)
*   **Rationale:** MVP pattern eliminates focus-stealing by ensuring view updates are controlled and debounced by presenter. Business logic separation makes code more maintainable and testable.

### [2025-06-09-102000] - Phase 3 ConfigWidget MVP Refactoring - MASSIVE ARCHITECTURE TRANSFORMATION
*   **Goal:** Refactor ConfigWidget from 824-line monolith to clean MVP pattern following DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md mandatory requirements
*   **Analysis:** Current ConfigWidget violated ALL MVP principles: business logic in view, direct configuration management, validation in UI, connection testing in view, print statements
*   **Actions:**
    - **COMPLETE TDD PROCESS**: Wrote failing tests for MVP compliance, then implemented to make tests pass
    - **Created ConfigPresenter** with ALL business logic: provider validation, connection testing, model management, configuration I/O (250+ lines of extracted logic)
    - **Separated SemanticSearchConfig** into config_manager.py module to resolve circular imports  
    - **Refactored ConfigWidget** to be "dumb" view: only Qt setup, simple setters/getters, signal delegation to presenter
    - **Eliminated violations**: Removed all validation, testing, configuration management from view layer
    - **Architecture compliance**: NO Qt imports in presenter, unidirectional dependencies (UI → Presenter → Config)
    - **Replaced ALL print statements** with structured logging using self.logger
    - **Reduced complexity**: 824 → 685 lines (17% reduction) while adding MVP structure
    - **Plugin builds successfully**: 138.2 KB confirms MVP components integrated correctly
*   **Rationale:** This massive refactoring brings ConfigWidget into full compliance with ARCHITECTURE.md System Invariants and DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md MVP patterns. Essential for maintainable, testable, and architecturally sound codebase.

### [2025-06-09-110000] - Git Debt Organization - Cross-Referenced Commit Structure
*   **Goal:** Organize all uncommitted changes into logical git commits that cross-reference with ACTIVITY_LOG.md phases
*   **Analysis:** Large accumulation of git debt from Operation Clean Slate work needed systematic organization into coherent commit history
*   **Actions:**
    - **Phase 1 Commit (d60d913)**: Workspace Refactoring & Knowledge Base Synthesis - SPARC-V-L³ documentation, archive creation, docs structure
    - **Phase 2 Commit (9672f54)**: Test Suite Triage and Repair - AsyncMock fixes, ThreadedJob integration, IndexDetector creation, repository auto-index creation
    - **Phase 3 Commit (f5bf40d)**: Core System Implementation & MVP Architecture - Logging integration, MVP presenters, ConfigWidget refactoring
    - **Cleanup Commit (f776d98)**: Workspace organization, file cleanup, documentation updates, test file organization
    - **Maintenance Commit (d91eebf)**: Add .claude_commands/ to gitignore for Claude Code integration
*   **Rationale:** Clean commit history with cross-references to activity log enables proper git workflow, change tracking, and future development context understanding.
