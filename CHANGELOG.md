## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (2025-06-05) - Critical Configuration Bugs

#### **üîÑ Circular Import Issue - LOCATION-UI-20250605-0840**
- **Problem**: Location dropdown widgets not appearing in settings UI due to circular import deadlock
- **Root Cause**: Module-level imports of `DynamicLocationComboBox` creating circular dependency with `SemanticSearchConfig`
- **Solution**: Implemented lazy loading of `LocationComboBox` inside `ConfigWidget._create_location_widget()` method
- **Result**: Dynamic location dropdowns now work correctly without circular import errors
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Moved imports from module level to method level to break dependency cycle
  - Added fallback handling for both `DynamicLocationComboBox` and basic `LocationComboBox`
  - Maintained backward compatibility with QLineEdit fallbacks

#### **üîß JSONConfig Save Error**
- **üîß JSONConfig Save Error** - Fixed critical bug where configuration saving failed with "AttributeError: 'JSONConfig' object has no attribute 'save'"
- Calibre's JSONConfig auto-saves when values are modified, no explicit save() method needed
- Resolves configuration dialog crashes when users try to save settings
- Plugin configuration now works correctly in Calibre 8.3+
