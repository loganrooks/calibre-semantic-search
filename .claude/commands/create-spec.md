Create detailed specifications for: "$ARGUMENTS"

## SPECIFICATION CREATION FRAMEWORK

### 0. Requirement ID & Git Setup
**Initialize Requirement Tracking**:
- Generate requirement ID if not exists: `/project:generate-requirement-id "$ARGUMENTS"`
- Use the ID throughout specification (e.g., FEAT-005)
- Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[ID]-specification`
- Ensure clean git state or run `/project:git-debt` first

### 1. Context Gathering
**Understand the Need**:
```bash
# Find related discussions/issues
grep -rn "$ARGUMENTS" --include="*.md" docs/ issues/ | head -20

# Check existing similar features
find . -name "*.py" | xargs grep -l "similar_feature_name"

# Review SPARC analysis if exists
cat *sparc*$ARGUMENTS*.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No SPARC analysis found"
```

### 2. Stakeholder Analysis
**Identify Who Cares**:
- **End Users**: What do they need?
- **Developers**: What do they need to build?
- **Maintainers**: What do they need to support?
- **QA**: What do they need to test?

### 3. Functional Specifications

#### 3.1 User Stories
```markdown
As a [role]
I want to [action]
So that [benefit]

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Criterion 1 (specific & measurable)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (specific & measurable)
- [ ] Criterion 3 (specific & measurable)
```

#### 3.2 Use Cases
**Primary Use Case**:
```
Title: [Main Scenario Name]
Actor: [Who initiates]
Preconditions: [What must be true before]
Trigger: [What starts this]

Main Flow:
1. User does X
2. System responds with Y
3. User provides Z
4. System validates and processes
5. System returns result

Postconditions: [What's true after success]

Alternative Flows:
2a. If Y is invalid:
    2a1. System shows error
    2a2. Return to step 1

Exception Flows:
*. At any time, if system error:
    *.1. Log error
    *.2. Show user-friendly message
    *.3. Allow retry or cancel
```

#### 3.3 Behavioral Specifications (BDD Style)
```gherkin
Feature: $ARGUMENTS

  Background:
    Given the system is initialized
    And user has necessary permissions

  Scenario: Successful [operation]
    Given [initial state]
    When user [performs action]
    Then system [produces result]
    And [side effect occurs]

  Scenario: Handle [edge case]
    Given [edge condition]
    When user [performs action]
    Then system [handles gracefully]
    
  Scenario: Error handling
    Given [error condition]
    When user [performs action]
    Then system [shows appropriate error]
    And [system remains stable]
```

            SpecificError: When X happens
            ValueError: When Y is invalid

## Specification Completion & Git Integration

### Commit Specification
- Stage specification files: `git add .requirements/[ID].md docs/specifications/`
- Commit with clear conventional format:
  ```
  git commit -m "docs(spec): create detailed specification for $ARGUMENTS
  
  Complete functional and technical specification including:
  - User stories with acceptance criteria
  - Behavioral specifications (BDD format)
  - API contracts and data schemas
  - Non-functional requirements
  - Test specifications and acceptance criteria
  - Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
  
  Related: [REQUIREMENT-ID]"
  ```

### Update Requirement Tracking
- Update `.requirements/[ID].md` status to "Specification Complete"
- Add specification commit hash to requirement document
- Update PROJECT_STATUS.md if relevant
- Link specification to requirement in registry

### Clean Up
- Run `/project:git-debt` to handle any remaining specification artifacts
- Ensure all specification work is properly committed and documented
- Prepare for architecture phase

## Next Steps
1. Get specification reviewed by stakeholders
2. Create architecture: `/project:architect [REQUIREMENT-ID]`
3. Begin implementation: `/project:tdd-cycle [REQUIREMENT-ID]`
4. Track progress against specifications using requirement ID

Remember: Good specs with proper tracking prevent bad surprises and ensure full traceability.
