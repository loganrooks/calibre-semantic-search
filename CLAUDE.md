# ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT TASK: Execute BLUEPRINT OPERATION CLEAN SLATE - Phase 1 Workspace Refactoring
- **PLAN:** BLUEPRINT_OPERATION_CLEAN_SLATE.md
- **STATUS:** Phase 1: Creating authoritative knowledge base after initial file organization

## ðŸ§  CORE DIRECTIVES (VERIFY ON EVERY ACTION)

1.  **SPARC-V-LÂ³ Protocol:** You MUST follow the full SPARC-V-LÂ³ cycle for all non-trivial changes as detailed in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.
2.  **TDD is Non-Negotiable:** No implementation without a failing test first. No bug fix without a replicating test first.
3.  **UI is Dumb:** UI classes contain NO business logic. All logic is in Presenters or dedicated modules, as specified in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4.  **Verification is Mandatory:** After all tests pass, the final step is ALWAYS to outline the manual `calibre-debug -g` verification steps for any user-facing change.
5.  **Log All Anomalies:** Any deviation from the plan, unexpected error, or user correction MUST be logged with structured detail in `FEEDBACK_LOG.md`.
6.  **Log Your Actions:** At the end of every response, you MUST append a structured entry to `ACTIVITY_LOG.md`.
7.  **Self-Critique:** After completing a significant task, you MUST perform a self-analysis and log it in `SELF_ANALYSIS_LOG.md`.

## ðŸ“š KNOWLEDGE BASE INTERACTION PROTOCOL

You are required to read the following documents at specific trigger points to ensure full context:

-   **WHEN:** Starting *any* new task.
    -   **READ:** `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` to refresh core principles.
    -   **READ:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the system context.
    -   **READ:** `PROJECT_STATUS.md` to understand the current state of the epic.

-   **WHEN:** Implementing a UI change.
    -   **READ:** The "UI Presentation Patterns (MVP)" section in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.
    -   **READ:** The relevant component diagram in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

-   **WHEN:** Modifying the database or repository layer.
    -   **READ:** The "Data Layer & Repository Pattern" section in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.

-   **WHEN:** A significant architectural decision is needed.
    -   **ACTION:** Propose a new Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `docs/decisions/` using the template. Do not proceed until the ADR is approved.

-   **WHEN:** A task is complete.
    -   **ACTION:** Propose updates to `CHANGELOG.md`.
    -   **ACTION:** Propose updates to `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
    -   **ACTION:** Perform LÂ² (Learn) step and update `SELF_ANALYSIS_LOG.md`.
    -   **ACTION:** If a systemic lesson was learned, perform LÂ³ (Level Up) step by creating a task to update the `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.

1. **ALWAYS** verify backups before destructive operations
2. **READ** and understand existing structure before reorganizing
3. **THINK** ultra hard before executing commands
4. **PRESERVE** valuable documentation while establishing new standards
