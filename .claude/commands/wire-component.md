Wire the component "$ARGUMENTS" into the live Calibre interface. Follow these steps:

1. First, verify the component exists and is tested:
   - Find the component implementation file
   - Check if there are passing tests for it
   - Show me the main class/function signatures

2. Find where it needs to be integrated:
   - Search for placeholder implementations related to $ARGUMENTS
   - Look for "pass", "not implemented", or QMessageBox placeholders
   - Check interface.py for integration points

3. Show me the exact code changes needed:
   - Current placeholder code
   - New code that calls the component
   - Any imports that need to be added

4. Verify no other dependencies:
   - Check if the component needs services initialized
   - Ensure any required UI elements exist
   - Look for async/await patterns that need handling

5. Create the integration code and explain each change
