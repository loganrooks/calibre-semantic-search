## 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix for v1.0)

1. **Async Error in Indexing Status** ✅ FIXED
   - Was calling async method synchronously
   - Fixed by using `run_until_complete()`

2. **Test Connection** ✅ FIXED (2025-05-31)
   - Was placeholder showing info dialog
   - Now actually tests embedding service
   - Shows success/error with provider details

3. **UI Terminology Clarified** ✅ FIXED (2025-06-01)
   - Moved chunk settings to Indexing tab
   - Created UI_TERMINOLOGY.md guide
   - Clarified indexing vs embedding relationship

4. **Documentation Chaos** ✅ FIXED (2025-06-01)
   - Implemented systematic documentation management system
   - Archived 11 outdated documents to proper locations
   - Reduced root directory to 4 essential files
   - Created maintenance workflow and health monitoring

5. **Search Not Connected** ❌ BLOCKER (NEXT PRIORITY)
   - Search dialog exists but shows "not implemented"
   - Backend SearchEngine ready but not wired up
   - Need to implement `_initialize_search_engine()` properly

6. **Indexing Not Connected** ✅ FIXED (2025-06-01)
   - Implemented real `_start_indexing()` method with full workflow
   - Added progress dialog with cancellation support
   - Connected IndexingService to UI with background threading
   - Complete flow: UI → IndexingService → EmbeddingService → Storage

7. **Right-Click Context Menu** ✅ FIXED (2025-06-01)
   - Implemented context-aware main action with `toolbar_action_triggered()`
   - Added proper `location_selected()` method for book selection handling
   - Fixed GUI initialization guards to prevent startup crashes
   - ⚠️ NOTE: Requires manual activation in Calibre Preferences → Toolbars & Menus → Context Menu

8. **Binary Data in Search Results** ✅ FIXED (2025-06-01)
   - EPUB files were showing raw ZIP headers (PK\x03\x04...) instead of text
   - Added validation to text extraction to detect binary data
   - Search engine now filters out results with binary content
   - Copy citation error fixed - now handles dict format from ResultCard

9. **Metadata Display Error** ✅ FIXED (2025-01-06)
   - Search results were showing "Unknown Author. Unknown." instead of actual metadata
   - Fixed JSON parsing in database.py - authors stored as JSON string needed parsing
   - Now correctly displays book authors in search results

10. **UI Theme Support** ✅ FIXED (2025-01-06)
    - Hard-coded colors made text unreadable in dark themes
    - Created ThemeManager class for dynamic theme-aware styling
    - All UI components now respect Calibre's theme settings
    - Works correctly with both light and dark themes

11. **Index Management UI** ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2025-01-06)
    - Created comprehensive IndexManagerDialog for index management
    - Shows index statistics, storage usage, and indexed books
    - Allows clearing selected books or entire index
    - Added to menu: Indexing → Manage Index...
    - Provides rebuild functionality

12. **Indexing Job System** ❌ IN PROGRESS (NEXT TASK)
   - Currently using basic threading instead of Calibre's ThreadedJob
   - Jobs don't appear in Calibre's job manager
   - Need to convert to proper job system for better integration
   - "Index for Semantic Search" action added
   - "Find Similar Books" with excluded books support
   - Complete integration with search dialog

## ❌ What's Still Missing

1. **View in Book Navigation** (search_dialog.py:423)
   - Opens viewer but doesn't navigate to the specific chunk/location
   - Need to implement proper viewer position calculation

2. **Viewer Context Menu** (interface.py:515)
   ```python
   def _inject_viewer_menu(self, viewer):
       pass  # Empty implementation
   ```
   
3. **Search Within Book** (scope limited)
   - Current book scope exists but viewer integration incomplete

## 📋 Implementation Plan

2. ✅ Fix UI theming - Created ThemeManager for dynamic styling  
3. ✅ Add index management - Complete UI for managing index
4. ✅ Test connection - Actually tests provider connection
5. ✅ Right-click context menu - Index and find similar books

### Phase 2: Remaining Features (1-2 days)
1. [ ] View in Book Navigation
   - Calculate chunk position in book
   - Navigate viewer to location
   - Highlight found text

2. [ ] Viewer Context Menu Integration
   - Implement `_inject_viewer_menu()`
   - Add search from selection
   - Add find similar passages

3. [ ] AutoCompleteScope Integration

### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization (Optional)
5. [ ] Local provider (Ollama)
   - Add to provider chain
   - Test offline functionality

6. [ ] Export/Import Index
   - Backup functionality
   - Share indexes between libraries
