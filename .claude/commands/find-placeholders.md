Find all placeholders and unimplemented functionality related to "$ARGUMENTS" (or all if no argument). 

1. Search for common placeholder patterns:
   ```bash
   grep -rn "not implemented\|will be implemented\|placeholder\|TODO\|FIXME\|pass$" calibre_plugins/
   grep -rn "QMessageBox.*will be\|info_dialog.*will be" calibre_plugins/
   ```

2. Find empty method implementations:
   - Look for methods that only contain "pass"
   - Check for methods that only show messages
   - Find try/except blocks with empty except clauses

3. If $ARGUMENTS provided, filter to relevant area:
   - Focus on files/classes related to $ARGUMENTS
   - Check integration points for $ARGUMENTS

4. For each placeholder found:
   - Show the file:line location
   - Display the placeholder code
   - Check if an implementation exists elsewhere
   - Estimate complexity (simple wire-up vs new implementation)

5. Prioritize by impact:
   - CRITICAL: Core functionality (search, indexing)
   - HIGH: User-visible features (UI, menus)
   - MEDIUM: Enhancements (plugins, optimization)
