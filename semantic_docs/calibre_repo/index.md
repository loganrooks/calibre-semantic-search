## Quick Reference

### Most Critical Rules:
1. **NO NumPy** - Use pure Python implementations
2. **Always use qt.core** - Never import PyQt directly
3. **Multi-file marker** - Required for plugins with multiple .py files
4. **Print debugging** - The official debugging method
5. **No sandboxing** - Plugins have full system access
6. **ThreadedJob for long operations** - Keep UI responsive
7. **Python 3 only** - Calibre 5.0+ requires Python 3.8+

### For Semantic Search Plugin Development:
- Use Report 3's VectorOps class for embeddings
- Follow Report 7's patterns for database operations
- Implement Report 3's binary storage for efficient embedding storage
- Use Report 4's ThreadedJob patterns for indexing operations
- Apply Report 8's troubleshooting guide for common issues
