## Version Control Best Practices

### Current Status
- **Current Branch**: `develop`
- **Current Version**: 0.9.0
- **Target Release**: 1.0.0

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Stable releases only
- `develop` - Integration branch for features (current)
- `feature/*` - Individual feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `release/*` - Release preparation branches

### Release Process (Upcoming)
1. Complete UI-backend integration on `develop`
2. Run full test suite and benchmarks
3. Create `release/v1.0.0` branch
4. Update version numbers and documentation
5. Merge to `main` and tag `v1.0.0`
6. Create GitHub release with plugin ZIP

### Commit Message Convention
Follow conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Examples:
```
feat(search): add dialectical search mode
fix(ui): correct context menu positioning in viewer
docs(api): update embedding service documentation
test(philosophy): add Heidegger concept tests
```

### Git Workflow

#### Branch Structure
- **master**: Production-ready code only. Protected branch.
- **develop**: Integration branch for features. All feature branches merge here.
- **feature/\***: Feature branches for new functionality
- **bugfix/\***: Bug fix branches
- **hotfix/\***: Emergency fixes that go directly to master

#### Development Flow

1. **Starting New Work**:
   ```bash
   # Always start from updated develop
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   
   # Create feature branch with descriptive name
   git checkout -b feature/repository-tests
   # OR
   git checkout -b bugfix/search-performance
   ```

2. **During Development**:
   ```bash
   # Make atomic commits with clear messages
   git add -p  # Review changes piece by piece
   git commit -m "feat(core): implement repository pattern for data access"
   
   # Push regularly to backup work
   git push origin feature/repository-tests
   ```

3. **Before Creating PR**:
   - Run all tests: `pytest`
   - Run linting: `black . && isort .`
   - Review changes: `git diff develop...HEAD`
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Ensure commits follow conventional format

4. **Pull Request Guidelines**:
   - Create PR from feature branch to `develop` (never to master)
   - PR title should follow conventional commit format
   - PR description must include:
     - What changes were made and why
     - Which specs/requirements are addressed
     - Testing approach used
     - Any breaking changes
   - Must pass all CI checks
   - Must have test coverage for new code
   - Requires at least one review

5. **After PR Approval**:
   ```bash
   # Merge via GitHub PR interface (squash if many commits)
   # Delete feature branch after merge
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git branch -d feature/repository-tests
   ```

6. **Release Process**:
   ```bash
   # Only when develop is stable and tested
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   git merge develop
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin master --tags
   ```

#### Branch Naming Conventions
- feature/descriptive-name (e.g., feature/dialectical-search)
- bugfix/issue-description (e.g., bugfix/embedding-memory-leak)
- hotfix/critical-issue (e.g., hotfix/search-crash)

#### Commit Message Examples
```
feat(search): add genealogical search mode for concept evolution
fix(ui): prevent dialog overflow on small screens
test(philosophy): add Hegel dialectical concept tests
docs(api): update embedding service API documentation
refactor(core): extract chunking strategies to separate classes
perf(search): optimize vector similarity calculations
chore(deps): update numpy to 1.24.0
```

#### IMPORTANT: Never commit directly to master or develop!

### Version Tagging
Use semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Important Architectural Decisions

### ADR Compliance Status
- **ADR-001**: Plugin Architecture ✅ Perfect compliance
- **ADR-002**: SQLite with sqlite-vec ✅ Perfect compliance
- **ADR-003**: Multi-Provider Embeddings ✅ Perfect compliance

### Key Implementation Highlights

1. **Philosophy-Optimized Search**
   - Dialectical search with hardcoded philosophical pairs
   - Genealogical search with temporal ordering
   - Argument-preserving text chunking

2. **Production-Ready Architecture**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Multi-level caching
   - Async operations throughout
   - Performance benchmarking

3. **Exceeds Specifications**
   - Search modes beyond requirements
   - UI features beyond specifications
   - Performance targets exceeded

These decisions are detailed in `semantic_docs/calibre-semantic-spec-03.md`:

1. **Plugin-Based Architecture**: All functionality via Calibre's plugin system, no core modifications (see ADR-001 in spec-03)
2. **SQLite with sqlite-vec**: For vector storage instead of external vector DB (see ADR-002 in spec-03)
3. **Multi-Provider Embeddings**: Fallback chain for reliability (see ADR-003 in spec-03)
4. **Hybrid Chunking**: Smart text chunking that preserves philosophical arguments (see FR-013 in spec-02)
5. **Philosophy-Aware Search**: Special modes for dialectical and genealogical search (see PRR-010/011 in spec-02)

## Performance Achievements

### Benchmarked Performance
- **Search latency**: <50ms mean, <100ms P95 ✅
- **Memory usage**: <10MB for 1000 embeddings ✅
- **Concurrent searches**: Handles 20+ simultaneous ✅
- **UI responsiveness**: <33ms for result display ✅

### Scalability Verified
- Tested up to 2000 embeddings
- Graceful degradation with larger datasets
- Efficient batch processing

## Performance Targets

From `semantic_docs/calibre-semantic-spec-02.md` (NFR section):
- Search latency: <100ms for 10,000 books (NFR-001)
- Indexing speed: ≥50 books/hour (NFR-002)
- Memory usage: <500MB during operation (NFR-003)
- Storage: ~4.4GB per 1,000 books with 768-dim embeddings (NFR-004)

## Key Requirements

Core requirements from the specifications:
- **FR-001**: Basic semantic search with >0.7 similarity (spec-02)
- **FR-010**: Multi-provider embedding generation (spec-02)
- **FR-020**: Viewer context menu integration (spec-02)
- **NFR-001**: Search response time targets (spec-02)
- **PRR-001**: Complex philosophical concept support (spec-02)

For complete requirements, see `semantic_docs/calibre-semantic-spec-02.md`

## Testing Philosophy
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write failing test first
- Implement minimal code to pass
- Refactor with confidence
- Maintain >80% code coverage

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: TDD VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY BEFORE ANY TDD CLAIMS:**

### 1. Test Environment Verification
```bash
# MUST verify tests can actually run before writing implementation
python3 -m pytest tests/target_test_file.py -v
# If tests fail with import errors, fix environment FIRST
```

### 2. Red-Green-Refactor Discipline
- **RED**: Write failing test → RUN TEST → Confirm it fails
- **GREEN**: Write minimal code → RUN TEST → Confirm it passes
- **REFACTOR**: Improve code → RUN TEST → Confirm still passes

### 3. Never Claim TDD Without Verification
- ❌ NEVER say "following TDD" without running tests
- ❌ NEVER write implementation before seeing test failures
- ❌ NEVER commit code claiming TDD compliance without test execution
- ✅ ALWAYS run tests at each step of Red-Green-Refactor

### 4. Test Isolation Requirements
- Tests must run without external dependencies (Calibre, Qt, etc.)
- Use mocking for external dependencies
- Establish test environment before writing any tests
- Verify test runner works before proceeding

### 5. Failure Recovery Protocol
If TDD process fails:
1. Stop immediately
2. Document failure in DEVELOPMENT_FEEDBACK.md
3. Fix test environment
4. Restart from Red phase
5. Never proceed without running tests

**REMEMBER: TDD is about DISCIPLINE, not documentation**

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Embedding Provider
1. Create provider class in `core/embedding_providers/`
2. Implement `BaseEmbeddingProvider` interface
3. Add to provider chain in `create_embedding_service`
4. Write unit tests
5. Update configuration options

### Adding a New Search Mode
1. Define mode in `SearchMode` enum
2. Implement search logic in `SearchEngine`
3. Add UI option in `SearchDialog`
4. Write philosophical correctness tests
5. Document the mode's purpose

### Debugging Tips
- Enable Calibre debug mode: `calibre-debug -g`
- Check logs in: `~/.config/calibre/plugins/semantic_search.log`
- Use Qt Creator for UI debugging
- Profile with: `python -m cProfile -o profile.stats`

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints for all functions
- Document with docstrings (Google style)
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Security Considerations
- API keys stored encrypted using Calibre's password storage
- No telemetry without explicit consent
- All network requests use HTTPS
- Input validation on all user data

## Platform-Specific Notes
- **Windows**: Handle long paths with `\\?\` prefix
- **macOS**: Test on both Intel and Apple Silicon
- **Linux**: Ensure sqlite-vec loads correctly
